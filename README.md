# Available models

Name          | Usage
--------------|----------------------------------------
Naive         | `from fold_models import Naive`
NaiveSeasonal | `from fold_models import NaiveSeasonal`
MovingAverage | `from fold_models import MovingAverage`

# Installation

- Prerequisites: `python >= 3.7` and `pip`

- Install from git directly:
  ```
  pip install https://github.com/dream-faster/fold-models/archive/main.zip
  ```
- Depending on what model you'd like to wrap, you can either install the library directly or run
   ```
  pip install "git+https://github.com/dream-faster/fold-models.git#egg=fold-models[<your_library_name>]"
  ```

# Quickstart




You can quickly train your chosen models and get predictions by running:

```python
  from fold import ExpandingWindowSplitter, train_evaluate
  from fold.utils.dataset import get_preprocessed_dataset
  from fold_models import Naive

  X, y = get_preprocessed_dataset(
      "weather/historical_hourly_la", target_col="temperature", shorten=1000
  )
  model = Naive()
  splitter = ExpandingWindowSplitter(initial_train_window=0.2, step=50)

  scorecard, predictions, trained_pipeline = train_evaluate(model, X, y, splitter)
```

Dream Faster is structured in an open-core structure.

We want to bring much-needed transparency, speed and rigour to the process of building Time Series ML pipelines. We're building multiple products with Fold and on top of it, but want to contribute to Time-Series Research by giving access to non-commercial use of the software, specifically for researchers.

We are providing copyleft for non-commercial use, so that researchers have access to Fold. If you are a researcher and would like to get access to Dream Faster's non-source available tools, please contact us here.
